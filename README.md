Hypervolume is a metric used in multiobjective optimization to quantify the quality of a set of solutions. It measures the volume of the objective space that is dominated by a set of solutions relative to a reference point. 

You can use different metrics to find "How well it approximates the Pareto optimal set?". So far, hypervolume metric is the best to do that (harles Audet, Jean Bigeon, Dominique Cartier, SÃ©bastien Le Digabel, Ludovic Salomon, Performance indicators in multiobjective optimization, European Journal of Operational Research, Volume 292, Issue 2,2021).
